## Program Notes

Change ringing is a musical and mathematical art performed on bells hung
intowers so they swing under control of ropes that hang to the ground. Like
Pyramider, the bells are large, round, metal, and notably loud with no volume
control. It takes a team part musician, engineer, and mathematician to play
either instrument.

Generally, the aim in change ringing is to play every possible permutation of a
set of bells without repeat. The methods for doing so are part composition and
part combintorics. In this work, the raw melodic materials are solely complete
sequences for sets of 5 or fewer bells using the method known as “plain
changes”.

Mark Lentczner studied electronic music composition with Ivan Tcherepnin at
Harvard’s Electronic Music Studio. This is his fourth work based on change
ringing. The prior three were written 30 years ago and premiered at Stanford and
Harvard. The present work is both Creative Commons and BSD licensed, with the
